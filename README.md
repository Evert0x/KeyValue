# KeyValue
A hacky key value storage, made during https://hackathon.money/.

A simple flask server that exposes public endpoints to store data based on a key.

## Hackathon
The is used for the following hack: https://github.com/Evert0x/Telegram/. Telegram id's are mapped to an Ethereum address. 
Applications like 
- https://github.com/Evert0x/ENSbot
- https://github.com/Evert0x/AaveBot

Are able to retreive the Ethereum address of their users.

## Deprecation

The ideal mapping is a smart contract that receives signed telegram id's. The mapping will be decentralised then.
